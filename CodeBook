General

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps.
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Data is merged with rbind() function.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Data is extracted
       using grep function and subsetting.  
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Activity names have been assigned
       from activity_labels.txt
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Additional column names have been assigned.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
       each variable for each activity and each subject. New dataset has been generated using ddply() function and
       saved as a .txt file format.

Variables
    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the source zip file.
    x, y and subject data are mearged from previous datasets.
    Data merges x, y and subject in a big dataset.
    dataavg was generated with ddply() function and contains the relevant averages which are later stored in a .txt file.
